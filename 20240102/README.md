2610. Convert an Array Into a 2D Array With Conditions

You are given an integer array nums. You need to create a 2D array from nums satisfying the following conditions:

* The 2D array should contain only the elements of the array nums.
* Each row in the 2D array contains distinct integers.
* The number of rows in the 2D array should be minimal.

Return the resulting array. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

**Note that the 2D array can have a different number of elements on each row.**

Example: 
    Input: nums = [1, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1];
    Output: [[1,3,4,2], [1,3], [1]]
    

# 定義 名為 findMatrix 的函數, 其功能是將依數字陣列轉換成一種特殊的矩陣格式。
